Wait less, do more.

Checkz is an attempt to solve a daily struggle and at the same time learn more about web development.

Today one of the most powerful tools that we can use is data, mainly real time data.

It is crucial to help us make smart choices, or not so smart as well.

I read about solving problems in lots of different media, and people always advise you to solve a problem that you care about and that you want to help solve.

Who likes waiting time?

Who likes to spend time waiting in line? Life is too busy to spend time doing nothing, at least, in my opinion.

Based on that, I have an idea to create a website to help us in our daily choices.

To achieve that there are a few simple steps to follow:


1 â€“ First, choose a place. Then, select a category. Finally, check a place as a favorite by clicking the Checkz button.

Right now, there are 3 categories: Eat, Health, and Fun.


2 - When in one of these previously checked places, update the current waiting time to help other users know.

For instance, if you save a certain restaurant as a favorite, and you are at that restaurant in a long line, you should update the current wait time using the Checkz website to insert real time data about this place.

If someone has this restaurant as a favorite, as well, it will update the current wait time for that user. Then, the most updated waiting time will be available for future users trying to make decisions.

3 - Users can share their current locations or pick any given location on the map, and they can choose to navigate to any of their previous locations. The Checkz website will take into consideration the current waiting time in a certain location, plus it will consider the traffic.

Users will be able to ask for navigation to one of the previous locations. Then, the shortest travel time, plus the shortest current waiting time will be used to help you make a smart decision.
